      <p class="caption-font">Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) is an income tax (IT) exemption available to salaried employees in India, by which the expense incurred for vacations in India is exempt from taxation. Although great in theory, arcane rules and a tedious process meant that very few people actually claimed LTA.<br><br>My task was to design a first-of-its-kind digital product which simplified the process of claiming tax benefits eligible under the LTA guidelines.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="lta-existing">
      <h2>Existing product</h2>
      <p class="article-text">I started out by thoroughly reading the rules governing LTA claims and also chatting with employees to get a good context. In my study, the main hurdles I observed were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Rules differ from other common IT exemptions.</strong><br>Eg. LTA can be claimed twice in a block of four calendar years. Other IT exemptions are calculated per one financial year (and can be claimed any number of times during that period).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Some rules aren't very straightforward.</strong><br>Eg. If the travel involves multiple modes of transport, then the hypothetical rail fare to the end destination is considered as the claim limit (even if you did not travel by train anytime during your journey).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>The process was tedious.</strong><br>Filling out physical forms and submitting hardcopies of documents was the only way of claiming tax exemptions under LTA. There was no digital product (or even a basic online portal) for filing an LTA claim.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Designing digital LTA claims</h2>
      <p class="article-text">The complete flow from submitting a claim, to processing it to and communicating the outcome to the user needed to be designed. From my study, it was also clear that user education and transparency was necessary</p>
      <p>We tested out two iterations based on two different hypotheses:</p>
    </section>
    <section id="lta-iter-1">
      <h3>Iteration 1: Simply upload</h3>
      <p class="article-text">In this iteration, the focus was on eliminating the hassle of the physical process. The employee wouldn't have to bother with any mundane form-filling. The process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Employee simply uploads all the tickets and documents</p></li>
        <li><p>Zeta’s claim-processing team takes care of entering the journey and traveller info and other details. Post that, the claim is processed.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Iteration 2: Itinerary-based flow</h3>
      <p class="article-text">Here, we concentrated on reducing the cognitive effort by removing any ambiguity about the documents to be uploaded.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Employee fills out trip and traveller details.</p></li>
        <li><p>Based on this, a specific list of documents to be uploaded is presented.</p></li>
        <li><p>Zeta's team only cross-verifies the info entered and the documents submitted and then processes the claim</p></li>

      <h3>Testing it out</h3>
      <p class="article-text">The process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The test was carried out amongst Directi employees across engineering, design, marketing, sales and HR departments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>I asked employees about their recent travels in India, informed them what LTA was (in case they weren’t aware) and asked them to go about filing a claim on a prototype app presented to them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For Zeta’s claim-processing team, we had a few sample tasks and documents corresponding with what employees would enter in each iteration.</p>
