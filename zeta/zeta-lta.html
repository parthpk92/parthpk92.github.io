    <!-- article intro =============================================================================== -->
    <section class="article-intro">
      <p class="caption-font">Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) is an income tax (IT) exemption available to salaried employees in India, by which the expense incurred for vacations in India is exempt from taxation. Although great in theory, arcane rules and a tedious process meant that very few people actually claimed LTA.<br><br>My task was to design a first-of-its-kind digital product which simplified the process of claiming tax benefits eligible under the LTA guidelines.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- section 1: existing =============================================================================== -->
    <section id="lta-existing">
      <h2>Existing product</h2>
      <p class="article-text">There was no digital method for filing LTA claims in the country – it was all submitting hardcopies and following-up offline. Thus, I had a clean slate in front of me while designing a digital solution for claiming LTA.</p>
      <p class="article-text">I started out by thoroughly reading the rules governing LTA claims and also chatting with employees to get a good context. In my study, the main hurdles I observed were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Rules differ from other common IT exemptions.</strong><br>Eg. LTA can be claimed twice in a block of four calendar years. Other IT exemptions are calculated per one financial year (and can be claimed any number of times during that period).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Some rules are rather unconventional.</strong><br>Eg. If the travel involves multiple modes of transport, then the hypothetical rail fare to the end destination is considered as the claim limit (even if you did not travel by train anytime during your journey).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>The process was tedious.</strong><br>Filling out physical forms and submitting hardcopies of documents was the only way of claiming tax exemptions under LTA. There was no digital product (or even a basic online portal) for filing an LTA claim.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Designing digital LTA claims</h2>
      <p class="article-text">The complete flow from submitting a claim, to processing it to and communicating the outcome to the user needed to be designed. From my study, it was clear that user education and transparency was necessary.</p>
      <p>We tested out two iterations based on two different hypotheses:</p>
    </section>

    <!-- iteration 1 ul and images ========================================================================== -->
    <section id="lta-iter-1">
      <h3>Iteration 1: Simply upload</h3>
      <p class="article-text">In this iteration, the focus was on eliminating the hassle of the physical process. The employee wouldn't have to bother with any mundane form-filling. The process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Employee simply uploads all the tickets and documents related to the trip.</p></li>
        <li><p>Zeta’s claim-processing team takes care of entering the journey and traveller info and other details. Post that, the claim is processed.</p></li>

    <section id="lta-iter-2">
      <h3>Iteration 2: Itinerary-based flow</h3>
      <p class="article-text">Here, we concentrated on reducing the cognitive effort by removing any ambiguity about the documents to be uploaded. A customized list of documents was presented to the employee.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Employee fills out trip and traveller details.</p></li>
        <li><p>Based on this, a specific list of documents to be uploaded is presented.</p></li>
        <li><p>Zeta's team only cross-verifies the info entered and the documents submitted and then processes the claim</p></li>

    <!-- testing them out ============================================================================ -->
    <section id="lta-iter-test">
      <h3>Testing them out</h3>
      <!-- <p class="article-text">A qualitative The process:</p> -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Candidates:</strong><br>Directi employees - working with other business units - across engineering, design, marketing, sales and HR departments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>The test:</strong><br>A qualitative, task-based test was what I chose to go with since I needed insights on the 'whats' and 'whys' of the two iterations.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>I asked employees about their recent travels in India, informed them what LTA was (in case they weren’t aware) and asked them to go about filing a claim on a prototype app presented to them.</p>
              </li>
              <li><p>For Zeta’s claim-processing team, we had a few sample tasks and documents corresponding with what employees would enter in each iteration.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>What I looked for:</strong><br>The primary goal was to see whether the employees uploaded all the required documents successfully. The ease with which they did this was what I was observing. A secondary goal was to see how well they understood any unconventional rules and tax calculations they encountered.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="lta-iter-1-test">
      <h4>The first iteration</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Employees were unsure of which documents to upload</strong> (even though a basic checklist list was provided in-app). Even after uploading the documents, they weren’t confident that they had gotten everything right.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Zeta’s processing team took significantly longer to fill in the details</strong> as compared to other IT claims. They also had very valid questions regarding liability - specifically, what would happen in case they incorrectly transcribed some info while filling the forms.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="lta-iter-2-test">
      <h4>The second iteration</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Employees quickly entered the trip and traveller info</strong> and proceeded ahead. No hesitation here.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>On seeing a specific list of documents, employees confidently proceeded to upload them.</strong> Signs of relief were apparent on the faces of those who had used the first interface earlier (verbal expressions of comprehension like “Ah!” were a common occurence)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Zeta’s processing team loved this model as they only had to verify the info</strong> entered by the employee against the documents submitted and not actually fill the form themselves.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="lta-test-conclusion">
      <p class="caption-font">Clearly, the itinerary-based model performed better with employees as well as Zeta’s processing team. It also made better business sense - as it meant less processing time for Zeta's team.</p>
